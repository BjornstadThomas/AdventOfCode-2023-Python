# Advent of Code 2023 - Python Solutions

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, where I'll be posting my Python solutions. 

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is placed in its own directory, structured as follows:

- `Day01/`
  - `part1.py`
  - `part2.py`
  - `input.txt`
- `Day02/`
  - ...and so on.

Common utility functions used across multiple challenges are located in the `Common/` directory.

## How to Use

To run the solutions:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the day's folder.
3. Run the Python script for the respective part, e.g., `python part1.py`.
